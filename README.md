This repo contains all the configurations for my ubuntu system it will also include some windows apps configurations.
I will update this every time i update sth on my PC.
There will also me a YT video showcasingg my linux setup on Ubuntu 25.04 (Not LTS, but will also work on any other distro).
You can do whatever you want with these files and if you wan you can jsut clone them on your pc so that it updates easily without re-installing it again.
